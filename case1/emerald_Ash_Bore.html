      <h2>What is a Emerald Ash Borer?</h2>
      <p>The Emerald Ash borer is a type of beetle that is native to north-eastern Asia. The adult beetles nibble on ash foliage but cause little damage.
        As of 2018, this bug can be found in 35 states, the Canadian provinces of Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Manitoba.</p>

      <h2>History</h2>
      <p>Established populations of EAB were first detected in the United States and Canada in 2002. EAB has become a serious pest of ash in North America and European Russia,
        is causing widespread tree mortality, and is spreading rapidly on both continents. In European Russia, EAB was first found near Moscow in 2003,but not officially identified until 2005</p>

      <h2>How can we stop/prevent them?</h2>
      <p>One way to prevent these bugs from spreading is buy kil-dried firewood or buy firewood from local sources and burn it where you buy it. Another way to stop them is don't move firewood from
        your property and burn any remaining firewood before spring.
        One last good way to stop these tree eating beetles is to inspect your trees.</p>
